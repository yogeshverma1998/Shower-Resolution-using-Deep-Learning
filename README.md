# Shower-Resolution-using-Deep-Learning

CNN-based novel classification approaches for shower resolution in calorimeter ranging from single particle to multi particle showers. More details availiable at [:page_facing_up:](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16247)

# Detector Modelling and Data Generation
Sampling type EM calorimeter modelled using GEANT4 simulation toolkit. Data is generated by simulating showers for single (π,γ) and multi particles (ππ,γπ, ...)  from 100MeV to 5GeV.


# Training
First change the path to dataset in [Photon_load.py](https://github.com/yogeshverma1998/Shower-Resolution-using-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Photon_load.py) and [Pi0_load.py](https://github.com/yogeshverma1998/Shower-Resolution-using-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Pi0_load.py) and then run following command
```js
python3 Train.py
```
